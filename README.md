<h1 align="center">Hi 👋 I'm Sefa ACAR!</h1>
<h3 align="center">
iOS Developer | Swift & UIKit Enthusiast | Open Source Contributor | Passionate about Clean Architecture
</h3>

<p align="center">
As an iOS developer with a passion for building scalable and user-friendly mobile applications, I see development as more than a job—it's what excites me every day.  
</p>

<p align="center">
With 2 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in creating modular, performance-optimized apps using Swift and UIKit, while also exploring the modern capabilities of SwiftUI. I focus on clean architecture, reusable components, and maintainable code with an emphasis on unit testing and performance.

I'm an active contributor to open-source iOS projects through platforms like <strong>iOS Roadmap</strong>, and I regularly engage with developer communities such as <strong>iCommunity</strong> to stay up-to-date and share knowledge.

Adapted to Agile/Scrum workflows, I thrive in collaborative teams, take ownership of my work, and align my efforts with project and company goals.
